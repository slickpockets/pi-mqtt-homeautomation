If:
homeassistant/thermostat/mode/set == "off"

Then:
1. Turn off all relays.
2. Publish message "off" to homeassistant/thermostat/mode/state

---

If:
homeassistant/thermostat/mode/set == "auto"

Then:
1. First turn off all relays.
2. Publish message "auto" to homeassistant/thermostat/mode/state
3. Automatically turn relevant system (aircon/heater/fan) on/off depending on current temp/humidity values.

If:
homeassistant/thermostat/mode/set == "cool"

Then:
1. First turn off all relays
2. Publish message "cool" to homeassistant/thermostat/mode/state
3. Turn on aircon when temperature is ABOVE target set in homeassistant/thermostat/temperature/state
4. Turn off aircon when temperature is AT OR BELOW target set in homeassistant/thermostat/temperature/state

---

If:
homeassistant/thermostat/mode/set == "fan_only"

Then:
1. First turn off all relays
2. Publish message "fan_only" to homeassistant/thermostat/mode/state
